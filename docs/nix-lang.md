# NIX language

## Attrs

Static attrs (attribute set) called `outputs`.

```nix
outputs = {
  foo = "bar";
};
```

## Functions

### Simple

Now `outputs` is a function, which takes a `attrs` as input-parameter.
The `attrs` contains a attribute called `inputParam`.

```nix
outputs = { inputParam }: {
  foo = "bar";
  inputParam = inputParam;
}
```

### Pattern matching

We call the function form above with the `attrs` `someSet` as parameter.
`someSet` has multiple subsets, and nix will automatically "ignore" `something` & `other`.
So the outputs function will only recvice the `inputParam` set.

```nix
someSet = {
  inputParam = {};
  something = {};
  other = {};
};

test = outputs someSet;
```

### Aliasing

With the `@` parameter we define a `alias` for the entire `{ ... }` input set.
Now its accessible via `inputs` attribute.
The `pattern matching` still applies and we can acess things directly aswell as all inputs.

```nix
outputs = inputs @ { inputParam }: {
  foo = "bar";
  inputParam = inputParam;
  something = inputs.something;
  other = inputs.other;
}
```

## Type signatures

The `function` `genAttrs` takes following inputs `::`
- list of strings `[String]`
- anonymous `function` or `lamda` which takes a `string` and returns `any`
and will return `->` a `AttrSet`.

```nix
genAttrs :: [String] -> (String -> Any) -> AttrSet
```

    forAllSystems = function:
      lib.genAttrs [
        "x86_64-linux"
        "aarch64-linux"
      ] (system: function nixpkgs.legacyPackages.${system})

## systems or not to system

Some attributes in `nix` need to know for which `system` its used for and some not.

```nix
nixosConfiguration = {};
homeConfiguration = {};
packages.x86_64-linux = {};
devShells.x86_64-linux = {};
```

To correctly configure this for a single system we have to:

```nix
devShells.x86_64-linux = let
    pkgs = import nixpkgs { system = "x86_64-linux"; }
in {};
```

Which is very repetitive for multiple systems.
Therefore we can use some helper functions.

```nix
      # pkgsFor: imports nixpkgs and sets the system for it.
      pkgsFor = system: import nixpkgs { system = system; };
      # forAllSystems: takes a function and injects all systems into it by using genAttrs,
      # special in genAttrs is that it will return the system as root name of the attrs.
      # e.g. genAttrs [ "foo" ... ] (name: {name = name;}) will return: foo = { name = "foo";}
      # so its used to add the system after the attribute which called the function as well as injecting into nixpkgs.
      forAllSystems = f: lib.genAttrs systems (system: f (pkgsFor system));
```
